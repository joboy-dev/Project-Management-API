## Set up on local machine
1. Clone the project by using the command in the terminal: `git clone https://github.com/joboy-dev/Project-Management-API.git`
2. Run the following commands:
    #### Windows
    * *`pip install -r requirements.txt` to get the necessary dependencies
    * *`py manage.py makemigrations` to have a database file
    * *`py manage.py migrate`
    * *`py manage.py collectstatic` which is essential for the ckeditor5 used in the project for creating and editing a project.
    * *`py manage.py runserver` to start up the develeopment server

    #### macOS/Linux
    * *`pip install -r requirements.txt` to get the necessary dependencies
    * *`python3 manage.py makemigrations` to have a database file
    * *`python3 manage.py migrate`
    * *`python3 manage.py collectstatic` which is essential for the ckeditor5 used in the project for creating and editing a project.
    * *`python3 manage.py runserver` to start up the develeopment server
3. Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project and add a `SECRET_KEY` variable:
    `SECRET_KEY = 'random characters'`
4. Create a `media` folder in the root directory of the project as well.

### OPTIONAL
You can create a virtual environment before running the commands in number 2.

#### Creating the Virtual Environment
* *Open your terminal or command prompt.
* *Navigate to the directory where you want to create your virtual environment.
* *Execute the following command:
    `python -m venv /path/to/new/virtual/environment`
* *Replace /path/to/new/virtual/environment with the desired location for your virtual environment. For example:
    `python -m venv .venv`
* *This will create a virtual environment in the current directory.
* *On Windows, you can also use the following command:
    `python -m venv c:\path\to\myenv`

Just do `python-m venv venv` to put the virtual environment in the project root directory

#### Activate the Virtual Environment
After creating the virtual environment, activate it:
* *On Windows:
    `.venv\Scripts\activate`

* *On macOS/Linux:
    `source .venv/bin/activate`

#### Deactivate the Virtual Environment
When youâ€™re done working in the virtual environment, deactivate it:
    `deactivate`
